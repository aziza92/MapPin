📝 Description

Our application harnesses the power of iOS 17.4 and MapKit to provide an interactive mapping experience. The primary feature of this application is a dynamic map that allows users to place a pin on their desired location. The pin is not just a static marker, it’s interactive and movable. Users can change the pin’s location by simply dragging it across the map. This feature provides flexibility and personalization, allowing users to mark any location that suits their needs
